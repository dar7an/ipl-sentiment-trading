I know Maxwell, Green and Jacks can contribute with the ball but having more batters doesn't necessarily mean your batting is stronger. \n\nThey really should just drop Du Plessis as he won't be there next season and they won't qualify for the playoffs. Let Jacks and Green open with Kohli at 3, or at worst Green coming in at 3.",

It\u2019s where the bulk of the runs need to be scored to take an unassailable lead in the game. Faf & Kohli are just not it. And they are our most experienced players who can consolidate on rapid starts from the openers. \n\nI would honestly put: \n\n1. Jacks \n\n2. Green (intent version) / Maxwell \n\n3. Faf \n\n4. Kohli (can play anchor, flexible depending on need) \n\n5. Green / Maxwell (spin bashing version) \n\n6. Patidar (spin basher) \n\n7. DK\n\n8. Lomror",

Basically try to find the maximum amount of power while keeping the shortest stroke possible. This ultimately puts a ceiling on the amount of power that can be generated but allows you to stay in control. The hitters basically do not hesitate to use a full shoulder turn and make no attempt to keep the stroke small. This means maximum power, but if the ball does anything unexpected, they will lose control. If there is no help for the bowlers, they will dominate the conventional batsmen, if there is any help, they will become largely irrelevant.",

He's struggled a bit with intent and mindset this season, and in recent years, and has not broken free like he potentially can against spin. I think it's fair to say that, and while this innings is good, hope he sustains a positive approach. \n\nAt the same time, it's also a bit early to say he's washed and over etc when he's piling on runs at a good clip against pace. That will still be useful, especially on pitches that aren't made of glazed concrete. He's also still got the hunger for runs and winning... And has shown he can step it up. Definitely more a mental switch than skill. Given its pretty much a given that he's playing the WC, I hope he makes the switch. We won't survive the WC with our conservative approach... And the switch becomes hard when it's not natural",
