Ashutosh Sharma tosses the coin and Rutu calls heads. And the coin lands on its side! Can you believe it! Ashutosh wins the toss! Wait a minute. Is that.......? Yes it is! Dhoni walks into the ground, just like it's 2019! He is having a heated argument with the match referee Virat Kohli. Reports say that Anushka Sharma is live streaming the incident on her Instagram, victimising Virat Kohli. Virat doesn't allow a re-toss! The eternal commentator Sunny G and 97 man Gautam Gambhir have walked to oppose Kohli. They seem to not care about CSK. Just here to bash Kohli. Ashutosh is declared the toss winner. But there's a twist! Thala denies a choice to Ashutosh Sharma! Just like he used to deny singles to his team mates! And Thala chooses Punjab will have a bowl! Everybody is worshipping thala for his masterstroke.\"",

Flicks it towards mid wicket, who dives forward and snaffles it up. Rahane is not going anywhere, though. He thinks it is a bump ball, and there is some uncertainty over whether the catch was clean too. **The ball clearly carried and Rabada did brilliantly to get his hands under it. Rahane has to go, and CSK have been rocked early!**\n\nAjinkya Rahane c Rabada b Arshdeep Singh 9 (7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 128.57",

Mitchell is beaten by the lack of bounce and gets pinned on the knee roll of the front pad. The height might not be an issue but was it heading down leg with the angle? **We go upstairs to find out. No bat involved, and Ball Tracking has the ball clipping the outside of leg stump. Very, very tight but it is Umpire's Call, and Mitchell has to go!**\n\nDaryl Mitchell lbw b Patel 30 (19b 2x4 1x6) SR: 157.89",

Well, he's still playing because he keeps wickets for 20 overs, helps in taking decisions and hits much needed sixes to boost the total towards the end of the innings. Adds more value to his team than many current IPL players. And of course, he's still there because it benefits the franchise and pleases the fans.

I still remember those days when CSK used to open with D Smith and McCullum, with Raina at 3. They would just take the game away from opposition in powerplay itself. That was fire power. Now when every other team has evolved to such power, CSK has devolved to Rahane, Gaikwad and Mitchell.... what a downgrade\u00a0",

                "comment": "Unbiased perspective from Indian fan enjoying all 10 teams in IPL:\n\nToday there were good hands from Mitchell and Thakur, and a very good innings from Jadeja. However, it\u2019s hard to understand how someone like Thakur can concentrate freely on their batting and the ball that\u2019s coming, when all that can be heard so loudly are chants of \u201cDHONI, DHONI!\u201d and \u201cWE WANT DHONI!\u201d. Surely that does anything but help the batter on strike, and is actually quite a negative distraction. The failure to support the batter on strike, and recognise the issue, speaks to the toxicity of CSK\u2019s fanbase, which of course was there in large numbers during the innings today. I used to love CSK, especially due to Indian legends like Dhoni and Jadeja, who have won so many games for them. But now having seen the problems with so many of their fans, I am less inclined to do so in the future. This likely won\u2019t be popular or necessary to say, but just the perspective of an unbiased Indian fan",

They know that if they win, they might be sixth on the table, but it\u2019ll reduce their chances of finishing sixth at the end of the season since they might actually qualify for the playoffs and win the title. Good strategy by the team management today.",
