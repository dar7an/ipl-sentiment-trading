Murali saying he doesn't wanna bowl this era as the game has changed.\n\nBro used to eat up entire batting line-up with his variations alone and was a menace for even the most skilled batters as they were just not able to read him. \n\nSomeone like Sehwag who would give zero respect to bowlers in general used to say that he feared murali the most coz he just had no idea how to face him and it was an embarrassment for him to face him for the first 6-7 years of international cricket",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for RCB this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of RCB on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think RCB will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.",

I am not denying he isn't a great of the game. But right now, he isn't matching the pace of this rapidly evolving format.",

That\u2019s not gonna help him at all.\n\nThe only problem with playing straight is he has to judge the line well in advance which is the exact reason he is playing cross. He is not able to judge the line early and is trying to be play comfortable shots when ball is much closer. But all these shots are good when you are a power hitter and not timer of ball.",

Remember his shenanigans vs NZ in the WC group stage?\n\nThe day ICT gets selfless team players like Yuvi and Thala is when we can resume winning ICC trophies",

There will be days where it will come off but days were despite trying it will not come off. It will take loss like the Ind vs SL 2014 T20 WC semi-final to realize the scope of the problem.",

Try to be inventive try something different to improve your game. You cant always expect the fireworks to come from the other end.  In this 1 situation he's just not got it I'm afraid.",

When he showed his frustration when he got out, I can guarantee he was upset that he didn't continue his innings and fetch more runs rather that anger at himself at his failure to accelerate. He just relishes his celebrity superstar status. This celebrity worship in this country for the past decade has led to our barren trophyless run.",

Kohli might have cost RCB 20 runs but RCB are NOT 20 runs below par",

If Head fails early, Markram can step in as an impact player. Conversely, if we have a solid opening partnership, Philips can replace Head as a Impact player to maintain the attacking momentum. We can also consider sending Klassen or another player at one down while keeping Philips in the middle-lower order for firepower.",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Kohli is not woefully out of form, he hasn't been able to accelerate at a ideal rate and that's something you can trust a player like him to fix.

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Finger goes up immediately and Markram is quick to review. No bat involved. Impact seems to have been just in front of off - it could be umpire's call. But we wait for ball tracking. Impact in line and that was dropping to hit the base of leg stump. Swapnil Singh, hit for a four first ball, gets the big wicket of Markram next. Kohli can't hold back his laughter as du Plessis takes Swapnil aside for some instructions. He won't mind how it's come, he'll be elated he got that wicket!\n\nAiden Markram lbw b Swapnil Singh 7 (8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 87.5",

So if the ball holds up in the pitch, or turns just a bit, you will mishit. Only the truly powerful guys like the West Indies players can avoid that since they can generate power even with lower backlifts. Dhoni is also like that. That's why they are consistent over decades.",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",
