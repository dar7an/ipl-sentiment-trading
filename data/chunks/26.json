Krunal\u00a0\n\nPaddikal is a useless batter outside of the power play and KL is woefully slow as an opener, his best position is in the middle order like we saw in the wc. Also Badoni isn\u2019t a finisher type player, he should be facing more balls which also allows KL to come in later. Ofc this is flexible based on the match situation (Stoinis/Pooran can come in early if required and etc). Also they could drop Paddikal all together and play Hooda instead.",

So imagine you are batting first and you have trent boult out of the 11 so he can be subbed in for power play and now you had a collapse and now for some reason instead of gulping your sorrows and trying to go for a par score you can defend with an impact sub bowler who can get you early wickets and put the pressure back on you bring out a batter who has more chance to contribute less because everything around them has already collapsed and bowlers are breathing fire (really bad if it's like the last 3 overs that rcb fid yesterday). Without boult because he was there as a sub you would basically bowl like mi vs srh 2020 in powerplay where mi lost brutally because they rested boult and others.",

Both in PBKS and in LSG. He's always surrounded by inconsistent batsman like Maxwell, Stoinis, Pooran. Even QDK is a bit of a slogger these days. He needs another experienced international level player who he can rely on. Virat has Faf, Rohit has Hardik, KL needs someone too.",
