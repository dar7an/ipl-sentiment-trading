Other teams are also there to win. England, South Africa and West Indies have proper t20 teams but they are not talked about as much as Australia, especially considering t20 is not the strongest suit of Australia. \n\nAfter a performance like that in the ODI World Cup, I thought Afghanistan would be talked about a lot but no,  everyone has just forgotten them and are busy riding Australia.",

I mean, dude you know the club will fuck with you regardless of history, they're doing it to your national captain. Why not just think of yourself for a bit? Tell them you're not interested in retention, go into auction, make millions. \n\nIt would be really cool to see where he ends up. Maybe RCB as the next captain? Maybe even PBKS? So many teams will be looking for a captain and would love to strengthen their bowling. I daresay Pant's captaincy has been a little lacking this year, and he will not have a problem giving it up to Bumrah to get him in the team. The possibilities are really exciting. Bumrah at MI has gotten so stale and let's face it, he should've been captain this year. 100%.",

Indians (fans especially) are too emotional, leagues abroad have trades and transfers going on all the time. \n\nPlay for money, mine the most of your playing years.

There's no one quite reliable like with teams like RR and KKR (who recover even after they have 5 down) and that sorta sucks, the amount of collapses in the last 5 games hasn't been pretty, it's sad how inconsistent the batting is and it also feels like everyone depends on the other to perform and show no initiative to asses the situation and play accordingly to dig the team out of the hole (esp disappointing when Klassen does this).   \n  \nSomething feels off and I think that's going to be the difference when it comes to why we're probably not winning this season compared to the top 2. Those 2 bad losses rly felt like they messed with the batting and it hasn't been the same since even, the mojo esp with the opening pair has been lost, and the holes are really starting to show. Today would've been a good day to bring in Glenn Philips.",

It kinda feels like they're all too nervy and don't have that confidence, and they all only perform if the others have performed. Our batting is just the so unreliable, and it sucks that Klassen never seems to deliver when we actually need it either. F  \n  \nFor a team that's supposed to be known for its batting, I get insanely nervous after we're about two down, exactly because of what's happening now, and that's not a good feeling esp when you compare it with the batting depth teams like RR and KKR. The collapses in the last 4-5 games have been very concerning, it never feels even remotely safe after 3 wickets fall. We need actual match-winners. I'm also not very confident with Abhi and Head as a pair anymore, feels like those 2 bad games killed the mojo and firepower of that pair.",

Our batting during those chases were terrible, but those losses have absolutely rattled this team and now they can't even deliver when we're batting first? I know it's normal to have off days but it's been about 5 games since the 287. Even teams like KKR and RR have off days but someone always steps up and it never seems to last for more than one game. SRH legit feels like they've been broken open.\n\nPat should promote himself to the middle order tbh. Feels like a way more reliable anchor at this point than anyone who comes in after number 4.",
