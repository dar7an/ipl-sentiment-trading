KKR vs RR: RR equaling it's own highest chaseable score with Buttler winning singlehandedly featuring 200+ scores on both sides and Narine scoring a century.\n\n3. GT vs DC: Low scoring match of the tournament with GT scoring only 89 and DC chasing comfortably in less than 9 overs. First time a WK is given POTM instead of the bowlers who ran down the batting.\n\n4. PBKS vs MI: PBKS almost losing with 4+ wickets in powerplay and suddenly at the end of 16 overs requires 28 off 24 balls. Then PBKS does PBKS and lose from that position.\n\n\n\nAll unique script by Jay Shah. Nominated for Best Writer at the Oscars.",

For now, he is relying on power game that he always had, hence makes sense for him to come in last 2-3 overs, middle some balls, and hit sixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to ask him to come at 10 over mark and make runs, unless team really shat the bed.\n\nPlus his injury woes further makes it difficult to bat up the order",

But more importantly, and i can\u2019t stress this enough as a straight male myself, he is the definition of a Man. Surely he isn\u2019t muscular but who needs muscles when you have those dark, thick and silky hair albeit shorter than what I\u2019d usually like but silky like no other. When he bats, canals in India clog with cum. When he bowls, canals in India explode with even more cum. One day I wish to meet him. I wouldn\u2019t be able to utter a word in the mighty presence of him and i doubt whether I\u2019d even be strong enough to maintain my consciousness in his presence. I\u2019d bust a quick nut right after i shake hands with him, with the same hand, just so his sensational touch can rest on my dick, forever.",

The way you dive into the catch and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth grip on the bat, and that gorgeous wicketkeeping stance. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.  \nYou had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the pitch, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face.  \nYou have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when CSK got suspended and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first IPL trophy once CSK was reinstated, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2016 and 2017 were hard years for us baby, but in 2018 you made history happen. You came back home and I couldn't believe it. 5 championships and 10 finals. Here's to 6 and 11 <3  \nIn 2020, I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, \"DEFINITELY NOT!\" Not only have you changed the game of cricket and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious THALA, MS DHONI.",
