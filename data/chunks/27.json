This new stadium is built by the camp that is opposed to PCA (Punjab Cricket Association), built with about 10k incremental seating capacity to the existing PCA stadium in Mohali, just a few kilometers away from each other, about an hour's drive from the team Hotel (which just kills momentum and energy for the home team) and quite away from the populated areas of Chandigarh, making it less accessible for the common man to watch and support PK team. \nA new stadium is definitely warranted in the state of Punjab, however I cannot understand why Amritsar city was not considered -  Decent population, more 'massy' population (Chandigarh is a city of elites - judges, lawyers, adminsitrators and hence the residents are less likely to go to stadiums), good flight connections domestically and internationally.",

It's a game where a single wrong decision by umpire can potentially change the course of the match. In that case why not just delegate the job of deciding out/ not out entirely to technology. Umpires can remain on the ground just to ensure smooth conduct of the game. No umpires call drama, no leaning towards \"on field call\" when the third umpire doesn't have \"conclusive\" evidence to overturn. Just technology all the way through is better imo.",

I guess that's how it is supposed to be..\nBut I'm curious to know how decisions are made especially related to bowling changes and field changes (to what extent is it driven by Sanju the captain vs Sanga the coach). Apart from Boult opening with 2 or 3 overs in the PP, and using Avesh in the 20th, RR's strategy differs starkly across every game",

Good start.\n\n\nPlayers climbing over each other to take catches? Even better.\u00a0\n\n\nMatch thread clutching pearls over a routine celebration? Hilarious.\n\n\nPunjab shithousing a decent total after being forced to use their impact sub in the first innings? Hysterical!\n\n\nThe specialist bowler that RR brought in not bowling a single over and then being sent to open and whacking Rabada for 4? Absolutely fucking comical.",

Keeps low too and goes under Samson's attempted pull. Gets pinned on the back leg, and umpire Anil Chaudhary raises his finger. Samson has a quick chat with his partner and then **reviews. This could be more in hope than expectation. And that is vindicated. Ball Tracking reckons the ball would have smashed into middle and leg, and Samson has to go. Takes a review along with him too!**\n\nSanju Samson lbw b Rabada 18 (14b 1x4 1x6) SR: 128.57",

Used rabada so well now to put RR on pressure with the wickets two of their main batters. Brar has been used really well too. The field placements have been very good too. I would love to see him be the permanent captain for pbks. Atleast dhawan might play better without captaincy pressure.",
