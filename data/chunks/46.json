Some aberations here, traditionally teams that have batted first have succeeded but not this season. Spinners haven't had a significant part in this season either as has been the case previously. It looks very dry, there's a mosaic underlay and there isn't really a sheen that you have come to expect in this year's IPL. Same surface that was used in that game against GT where CSK scored over 200 runs. This pitch produces the greatest degree of turn, 2.4 degrees as compared 1,8 degrees compared to the other pitches. Still think there will be some assistance for the spinners and for those who can bowl slower delivers but there's still runs on the board. Might just want to have couple of extra overs of spin up your sleeve. There might be significant dew later in the evening\" say Anjum Chopra and Samuel Badree",

Can't expect him to hit every game , wont be surprised if he goes off early today , Gaikwad and Rahane need to step up their game , especially Rahane , he has to go crazy in that first 6 overs and don't care about his wicket - If Moeen Ali is playing , he can also play a quickfire innings. Don't see CSK winning (if they bat first) AND if they don't follow a certain plan to attack\n\nIf CSK bat second , none of these will matter as I think (controversial opinion) that CSK bowlers will get quick wickets and get them to a below 180-190 score , but still CSK may take it a little deeper than required.",

I feel like his body never recovered after playing that exhausting Gabba test which is the reason why we couldn't have this excellent yorker bowling man in our long term scheme of things.\n\nEdit: same issue is with Varun Chakkarvarthy",

We need someone who can perform like Jaiswal, Gaikwad, Abhishek, etc. It's not like there's a scarcity of openers in India.

It might hold more weight in the groups but they're going to have to significantly tweak this style of play once they reach the knockouts, because I don't see them winning a title like this.\n\nAs for this match, I can only see a moment of individual brilliance from both or either Klaasen or Samad saving SRH.",

This strategy is starting to annoy me, they're too dependent on the openers performing and yet again the top order, esp Head and Abhishek threw it away when we were on par with the RRR. It's terrible because it puts too much pressure on these dudes and when they actually have to go, they can't bc it's too risky. Absolutely nothing is connecting and it's fuckin slipping away cus the gap is widening. 107 in 15 overs is fucking abysmal. What the fuck are they doing?\u00a0",

Threw their wickets for no reason when the RRR was on par, then when they needed to pick up after the 10th over they just withdrew. Nitish scored 16(15), Klassen with 21(20), Samad is 19(18) when we needed 14+ an over. Jesus. Just terrible. And yea, ofc they get going when it's too late now.",

Just like Bazball, you cannot redefine the game unless you have the most talented players in the game, which SRH doesn't have. You can double down on your strengths and become one dimensional because you're simply not that good, and it's not good to buy your own hype. Once the conditions change to what you're not suited to, you collapse because you are one dimensional.",
