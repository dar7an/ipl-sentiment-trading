          "comment": "Reading reports that pant is likely to be the keeper and VC for WC.\n\nwtf is this man. I agree, he is a talented player. But does he have Jay Shah nudes or something? His accident, while terrible and I wish him the best, he was stupid and acting recklessly. Would BCCI invest in any other player as much as this? And how he gets to waltz back into the team?\n\nSo other players need to prove in international level, but Pant can come back after IPL stint?\n\nWhat more does Samson need to do honestly? This is a case of politics. Absolutely crazy.",

Let's see if DC can turn it around in these last 4 and get to a modest 170 ish.\u00a0",

Sanju may not have shown us great results in T20Is so far but he sure has shown enough potential - he can bat sensibly when things are tricky and very well knows how to change gears.
