But when you have a large pool, purely on a professional basis, it doesn't make sense to keep playing the same squad when you already have a fair sample size for assessment, even under the guise of 'experience' which clearly hasn't worked for years. \n\nThere's a good crop of players who can genuinely play T20, don't have the baggage of knockout losses (yet) and aren't intimidated. \n\nI know it won't happen because broadcasters and hero worshippers won't allow it, but this is a fact. \n\nSelectors have to braver and avoid being safe for once.

He is trying to apply his GOAT ODI skills in these cases, to try and get risk free runs by rotating the strike, but it is an outdated way to play in modern T20s, especially on IPL flat tracks in tiny grounds. We saw this a few years ago in a game where both Gill and Kohli scored hundreds at different speeds. Kohli's won our hearts. Gill's won the match.",

Everything about Klaasen's T20 setup, stance, backlift, swing is done in such a way that he is looking to hit the ball for a six. If he can't do that, he looks to rotate strike, and if not he can defend it.\n\nIn comparison, Kohli lunges forward and goes with his hands and looks to manipulate the balls into gaps. If he gets a really bad ball he will try and hit it for a boundary.\n\nNo amount of nudging and nurdling and running hard can make up for the very basic fact that 4s and 6s are worth more than 1s or 2s. Simple as that.",

Legit, the disparity between his stats when winning and losing the toss is pretty significant, especially in ODIs.\n\nYos Buttler - Very rare, only ever sighted in the Netherlands.

I also think that is precisely how a t20 opener should bat. 113* in 72 balls, just under 10 an over (9.4ish to be exact) against the best bowling unit in the league. He set a platform for others to get 30(10), 24(7), 12(4) etc - but no one did. \n\nAnyway, now I have finished dickriding, if RCB lose (as I write this now RR are 54-1 from 6 overs) all of the criticism, blame and scrutiny will go on Kohli. Probably using his strike rate as their reasoning - but in reality it\u2019s an excuse. If RCB lose and you find yourself slandering Kohli, you don\u2019t understand cricket at all.",

Not much cohesion at all.\n\nIt\u2019s blatantly obvious whenever Green and Kohli have batted together, there\u2019s been so many dodgy runs or almost run outs. Complete lack of communication.\n\nFor any other Aussies in here it\u2019s the exact same feeling that I get watching the West Coast Eagles. They just also don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re putting as much effort in as other teams.",

RCB only were down 3 by the end of their innings.. \n\nVirat is slow death. He will bring down the run rate. His partner will focus on run a ball too.. \n\nVirat will never get out which means.. it will be too late for others.. and they will get out.\n\nYou need to have the guts to go all out in the beginning of the innings.. like Abhishek Sharma.. 37 in 12 balls. that is 10 times betters than 100 in 90 balls.",

Also I\u2019m pretty sure they were aware of the dew factor is Jaipur and that\u2019s why Sanju opted to bowl. 180 to chase here isn\u2019t looking tough.",

People had forgotten the pure brilliance of the great Lalit Modi and his vision when he had conceived a league where RCB fans watch their bowlers be taken to the cleaners and are made to question their life choices. The very first match of IPL Bazball had taken birth and later Yuvi, Gayle and Dhoni took their teams to such unconquerable peaks. Suddenly people had forgotten this and were shagging to dot balls and maidens. Glad that the original vision is back today.",

Kohli and KL almost find it impossible. KL looks like he doesn't talk to anyone for an hour after getting out, and Kohli can't just be another guy who contributes, so we have this.

And even Kohli wouldn't come and say sorry my innings was a little slower and could have scored 20-30 runs more. Nope, he would go off and cry like I don't play for milestones and shit, while we all saw only 4 runs being scores in the 19th over.

Rohit, Kohli, and Rahul faced the bulk of the deliveries all tournament. When they all got out early in SF, the untested middle order didn\u2019t know what to do.    \n\nSame thing here. Kohli\u2019s approach should be to hit and get going, not to protect the team from crashing. Rohit does that with MI - he goes if he can\u2019t score, thus giving the middle order time to get their confidence and back their skills.   \n\n\nTilak, SKY, Kishan, Hardik would\u2019ve floundered badly at RCB.",

That argument might be valid if Kohli got out after his fifty and entire team collapsed after that. But, that wasn't case tonight. He played 72 balls(including pp) which leaves rest of the team 48 balls and the fact that Green only got 6 deliveries while patidar and dk yet to bat shows how safe he was playing. Imagine every opener comes with a mindset that if he get outs team will collapse so he plays safe by scoring 100(70).\nI hate RCB, so im  happy to see them losing every match lol but i don't want the same thing to happen in WC",

One of us (Virat or Faf) had to bat till the end. I feel this total is effective on this pitch. I am not coming in with any premeditation. I knew I couldn't get over aggressive, just that I had to keep the bowlers guessing. It's just experience and maturity of playing the conditions. Even if there's dew, the surface is rough and dry, won't be easy for the batters. I couldn't get under the ball against Ashwin. Couldn't slog towards mid-wicket, so had to target straight down the ground.",

It's the lack of balance in their lineup\n\n1) Kohli and Faf are too similar in terms of batting style, and it doesn't make sense to play them together.  They need an opener who can attack from the very first ball and make use of the powerplay like Chris Gayle used to do\n\n2) Green should bat at No. 3 and Maxwell should come in at No. 6\n\n3) They need a somewhat consistent middle order batsman and it sucks that they haven't groomed any domestic player to do that job all these years\n\n4) They should buy players who fit in the squad instead of going for big names, but ig RCB is more focused on brand value than performance and I don't blame them for that tbh",
